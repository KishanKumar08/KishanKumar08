## About

I specialize in designing and operating distributed backend systems that handle real-world production workloads reliably and efficiently.

Currently working as an AI Engineer at **Insurance Samadhan**, where I:

- Architect Kafka-based event-driven microservices
- Build production LLM + RAG pipelines
- Optimize backend systems for throughput and latency
- Design fault-tolerant async processing workflows
- Implement observability and centralized logging infrastructure

Key Impact:
- Increased system throughput **3×**
- Reduced backend latency by **56%**
- Lowered infrastructure costs by **92%**
- Improved document extraction accuracy by **40%**

## Featured Project

### VID — Verifiable Distributed ID System

A cryptographically verifiable, time-sortable distributed identifier system designed for high-concurrency environments.

- 18-byte compact format
- HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- Monotonic sequencing with deterministic conflict resolution
- Benchmarked with 10M+ parallel ID generations (zero collisions)

Repository:

## Engineering Approach

- Design for failure from day one
- Optimize for performance and cost
- Build systems that scale predictably
- Keep architecture clean and observable
- Ship AI systems that work in production, not demos
